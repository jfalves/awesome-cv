      A marketing and advertising company needed dashboards to track social networking data, which was enriched by its employees by adding keywords using Google sheets.

      When I started the project, my role was to create database model and dashboards but there was legacy python code from which I made improvements by adding a database management framework (ORM). Later, there was a need of database migration, confirming the right decision to add an ORM.

      \textsc{Techonologies used}: Python, SQL Alchemy, SQL Server, Postgres, Api Google Docs, Tableau.

      This was one of my projects for the MBA in Business Intelligence, where I compiled public procurement data from Brazilian government.

      The data was consumed through a web API, generating flat files. These files were inserted into database and made available by a visualization tool.

      Over time I have intention to make this vision available to the Brazilian population.

      \textsc{Techonologies used}: Pentaho, Postgres, Power BI
